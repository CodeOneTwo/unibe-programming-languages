# Exercise 1

[./person.js](https://github.com/CodeOneTwo/unibe-programming-languages/tree/master/u8/person.js)

1. name is implemented as a public property so it exists on the this context of the Person function
2. password is implemented as a private property that is specified on the this context of a prototype method (every object will have it's own this context)
   setter and getter are implemented
3. counter is implemented as a static property in javascript it exists on the Person function

(the above provided solution is also the way a typescript transpiler translates typescript classes into javascript es5 code)
