```
mod :: Int -> Int -> Int
factors n = [x | x <- [1..n-1], mod n x == 0 ]
```
This part of the code defines a list comprehension in which each element x is applied the function mod and compared to zero
In the end we get a list of Int
simplified we can specify the type of factors

```
factors :: Int -> [Int]
```

The `:t` of haskell says the type definition looks as follows

```
factors :: Integral a => a -> [a]
```


```
isPerfect n = sum (factors n) == n
```
Compares the sum of all factors and to the provided number returns a boolean

```
isPerfect :: Int -> Bool
```



```
insert _ n [] = [n]
insert 0 n l = n:l
insert i n (x:xs) = x : insert (i-1) n xs
mH (a, b, c) = c
```
